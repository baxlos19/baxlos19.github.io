# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Carlos and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://wwww.fullerton.edu/) and my major is computer science.

## CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Didn’t involve much code at all but it was an exciting introduction. As someone who didn’t have any experience printing out a statement in code that appears in a terminal was cool. It opened my eyes and led me to be more interested in computer science and what it has to offer.

* Lab 7 

    part-1 was one of my favorite programs because it was a guessing game. It was cool that every guess the user made kept decrementing from 5 until 0 if the person lost. And there was a response for everything like if you guessed high, or low and if you won or lost and at the end it would reveal the secret number.

* Lab 8

    part-1 was also cool using nested loops to create a pattern. Also by decrementing and incrementing to create the pattern. It was a bit tricky at first but it was manageable. 

I love computer science.
